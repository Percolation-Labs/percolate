# Misc

## Functions
- make it easier to enable default functions or add them from external refs. 
- add discovery and reachability tests for referenced functions
- create a discovery test space e.g. hundreds of functions and hypothetical calling sequences - this should replace the idea of static graphs

## Infra
- add Docker registry on the server so that custom APIs can be added - this would be mapped to custom-api:5000 for example and any functions here would be discoverable by default

## DB

### Embeddings

- allow column embeddings to be toggled on and off / add to config in site - for example sessions could be embedded but disabled by default
-
