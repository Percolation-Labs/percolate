  This function compacts Userâ†’Concept relationships when they exceed a threshold.
  It inserts a Hub node between them for each user and relationship type.

  This function which could be generalized to other node types specifically compacts relationships between User and Concept nodes.
  It's assumed that the users node has a user_id which is important for qualifying user memories by named entities.

  A threshold defaults to 7 which means that as users have greater than 7 direct links we insert a Hub Node between them. 
  If we need to later add more direct links they will always be merged onto the same hub node for that user and that relationship type.
  For example the relationships 'likes' or 'has-skills' will be linked to a hub for that relationship type.

  Today we do not compact hubs but another process could do that in future e.g. like-good-italian or something very specific.
  The true value of this for now is simply knowing that the relationships exist and can be expanded. Recall that this expansion as far as actual entity lookups should be small data.

  Example:
    SELECT * FROM p8.perform_compact_user_memory_batch(5);
