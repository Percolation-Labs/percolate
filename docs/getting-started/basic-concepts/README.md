# Basic concepts

Percolate is a relational-vector-graph database for agentic systems. You can use Percolate as a database and as a data catalog for agents, tools and langauge models. You can also build in Python and connect to the database to build agentic systems if you prefer. In this section we describe some high level ideas about the design of Percolate.
